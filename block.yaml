#The play has three tasks t1 t2 t3
#Task2 is a block with three tasks b1 b2 b3, a rescue block with r1 r2 r3, and an always block with a1 a2 a3.
#You can make any of the tasks fail by declaring a corresponding variable when you run it. For example, to make second task in block and second task in rescue fail:
#ansible-playbook block.yaml -e b2= -e r2=
- hosts: localhost
